# UniEvents
UniEvents is a campus-focused event discovery platform designed to help students stay informed about what’s happening around their university. Many campus events go unnoticed due to limited promotion methods such as posters or restricted announcements on official portals. UniEvents addresses this by providing a central place where students can easily discover, save, and share events, while allowing event organizers to request event listings through a simple submission process. The platform ensures that campus events are visible, accessible, and well-organized for the entire student community.

## Project Overview
UniEvents provides a centralized platform focused specifically on campus events, allowing:

- Public users to browse and search upcoming campus events
- Registered users to save and share events
- Event organizers to request the addition of their events
- Administrators to manage, approve, and publish events through an admin dashboard

By separating public access from administrative control, UniEvents ensures that event information is both accessible and well-managed.
